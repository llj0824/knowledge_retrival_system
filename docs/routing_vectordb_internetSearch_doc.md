# **Engineering Implementation Document for VitaDAO AI Terminal**

---

## **1. Overview**

The **VitaDAO AI Terminal** serves as a knowledge retrieval system aimed at providing comprehensive, real-time, and intelligent responses based on **VitaDAO's tokenomics**, **research intellectual property (IP)**, and **ongoing updates**. The system is designed to handle queries effectively through an integrated architecture that incorporates three key components:

- **Internet Search Integration** for real-time data retrieval from specified web sources.
- **Vector Database Integration (ChromaDB)** for fast, semantic-based retrieval of VitaDAO's stored documents and blog content.
- **LLM-Driven Query Routing** to intelligently decide whether a query should be resolved using internal knowledge, a vector search, or an external web search.

This document outlines the entire implementation strategy, code examples, architectural design, and integration processes necessary for building this system.

## **2. Internet Search Integration**

### **2.1 API Choice & Comparison**

For integrating **web search** capabilities into the **VitaDAO AI Terminal**, we have selected **SerpAPI**, which offers a reliable and customizable way to query multiple search engines (e.g., Google, Bing) for precise results. Below is a comparison of **SerpAPI**, **Google Custom Search**, and **Perplexity** in terms of use cases and implementation:

#### **SerpAPI**
- **Advantages**: Provides precise control over search results by allowing users to specify exact search terms, including filtering based on specific websites or domains (e.g., `site:vitadao.com`). It supports crawling deeper into websites and provides more granular access to organic search results, including sublinks.
- **Use Case**: Ideal when you want to perform deep searches on specific websites and sublinks, particularly for niche or domain-specific queries.

#### **Google Custom Search**
- **Advantages**: Direct integration with Google's search engine. It provides relatively broad coverage and can be customized to search only specific domains.
- **Use Case**: Useful for simpler or less frequent search tasks across specific sites or domains, though it does not support deep-link crawling as effectively as SerpAPI.

#### **Perplexity**
- **Advantages**: AI-driven, natural language search designed for question-answering with direct responses pulled from web pages.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for natural language queries with a focus on returning direct answers rather than URLs or sublinks.

##### **Code Example Using SerpAPI:**

```python
import serpapi

# Initialize SerpAPI client with API key
search = serpapi.GoogleSearch({
    "q": "VitaDAO blog site:vitadao.com",
    "api_key": "your_api_key"
})

# Get search results
results = search.get_dict()
for result in results['organic_results']:
    print(f"Title: {result['title']}, Link: {result['link']}")
```

This code shows how to search specifically on the `vitadao.com` domain and its sublinks using **SerpAPI**.

```python
import requests

def perform_search(query, site=None):
    api_key = "your_api_key"
    if site:
        query += f" site:{site}"
    url = f"https://serpapi.com/search.json?engine=google&q={query}&api_key={api_key}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    results = response.json().get("organic_results",[])
    return results
```

This code searches focus on explicitly mentioned sites (e.g., VitaDAO blog) and their sublinks, prioritizing depth over breadth, with no caching for fresh results. Code example:

### **2.2 LLM Web Search Capabilities**

Several LLM platforms like **OpenAI's GPT-4** and **DeepSeek R1** are capable of conducting web searches as part of their response generation process. When using an LLM for web search, it’s crucial to direct the model to search within specific websites or domains to ensure that the retrieval process remains relevant and focused.

#### **Example Using OpenAI GPT-4 for Web Search:**

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = 'your_api_key'

def perform_search(query):
    # Prompt GPT-4 to search within a specific site
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        prompt=f"Search for information about '{query}' on the website site:vitadao.com.",
        max_tokens=100
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example search query
result = perform_search("VitaDAO tokenomics updates")
print(result)
```

This code directs GPT-4 to search for data specifically from `vitadao.com`, ensuring it focuses on that site and any relevant sublinks.


```python 
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
import json

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

def decide_action(query):
    prompt = PromptTemplate(
        input_variables=["query"],
        template="Given the user's query: {query}, decide the best way to answer it. You can choose from:\n- vector: Query the vector database for internal knowledge.\n- search_focused: Perform an internet search focused on specific sites like vitadao.com. Specify the site in the 'site' field.\n- search_general: Perform a general internet search.\n- llm: Use the base LLM knowledge for general information.\nRespond with a JSON object containing the 'action' and any necessary parameters."
    )
    chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
    response = chain.run({"query": query})
    try:
        action = json.loads(response)
        return action
    except:
        return {"action": "llm"}  # Fallback to LLM if parsing fails
```

this code guides LLMs in performing directed internet searches, we use prompts to specify actions and parameters, ensuring focused searches on trusted sites. The LLM outputs a JSON response, parsed for execution. Example prompt:

Examples:
Query: "Latest VitaDAO tokenomics updates" → LLM outputs {"action": "search_focused", "site": "vitadao.com"}, searches VitaDAO blog.
Query: "General market trends" → LLM outputs {"action": "search_general"}, performs broad search.
Query: "VitaDAO research papers" → LLM outputs {"action": "vector"}, queries vector database.
Query: "Meaning of life" → LLM outputs {"action": "llm"}, uses base knowledge.

## **3. Vector Database Integration (ChromaDB)**

### **3.1 Data Ingestion Flow**

The core of our knowledge retrieval system involves storing document embeddings in a **vector database** for efficient querying. **ChromaDB** is selected as the database for its performance and support for high-dimensional vector search. Below is the comprehensive process for data ingestion, starting from scraping blog posts to embedding and storing them in ChromaDB.

#### **Step 1: Scraping Blog Posts from VitaDAO Website**

To ingest blog posts from the VitaDAO website, we will use **BeautifulSoup** and **Requests** to scrape the content. Each post will be split into smaller chunks (such as paragraphs) to facilitate efficient embedding and searching.

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

def scrape_blog_posts(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    posts = []
    for post in soup.find_all('article'):
        title = post.find('h2').text
        content = post.find('p').text
        posts.append(f"{title}\n{content}")
    return posts

url = "https://www.vitadao.com/blog"
posts = scrape_blog_posts(url)
```

Another example
```python 
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

def get_post_urls(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
    post_urls = []
    for post in soup.find_all("article"):
        link = post.find("a")
        if link:
            post_urls.append(link.get("href"))
    return post_urls

def scrape_post_content(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
    title = soup.find("h1").text
    content = soup.find("div", class_="entry-content").text
    return f"{title}\n{content}"

def scrape_all_posts(main_url):
    post_urls = get_post_urls(main_url)
    posts = []
    for url in post_urls:
        posts.append(scrape_post_content(url))
    return posts

url = "https://www.vitadao.com/blog"
posts = scrape_all_posts(url)
splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
chunks = splitter.split_text("\n".join(posts))
```

#### **Step 2: Generating Embeddings Using SentenceTransformers**

After partitioning the text into appropriate chunks (e.g., paragraphs), we generate **embeddings** for each text chunk using **SentenceTransformers**. This is essential for semantic search, enabling retrieval of the most relevant documents based on meaning rather than keyword matching.

```python
from langchain.embeddings import SentenceTransformersEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

def generate_embeddings(posts):
    embeddings = SentenceTransformersEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
    vectorstore = Chroma.from_texts(posts, embeddings, collection_name="vitadao_blogs")
    return vectorstore

vectorstore = generate_embeddings(posts)
```

#### **Step 3: Storing Data in ChromaDB**

Once the embeddings are generated, they are inserted into **ChromaDB** for fast retrieval. ChromaDB allows efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings, making it suitable for large-scale applications.

---

### **3.2 Querying the Vector Database**

After storing the embeddings, querying the database becomes the next crucial step. To perform a query, we utilize **ChromaDB's similarity search** capabilities, which allow us to find the closest matches to a user’s query.

```python
def query_vector_db(query, vectorstore):
    result = vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=5)  # Retrieve top 5 similar results
    return result

query = "What are the latest changes in tokenomics?"
results = query_vector_db(query, vectorstore)
print(results)
```

This query retrieves the top 5 results from ChromaDB that are most semantically similar to the user's question.


```python
from chromadb import Client
client = Client()
collection = client.get_collection("vitadao_blogs")
all_docs = collection.get()
print(all_docs['documents'])
```

This query shows all the documents.

---

## **4. Routing User Queries & Query Logic**

### **4.1 Reasoning LLM for Tool Selection**

The **Reasoning LLM** is a key part of the query routing logic. It determines whether to query the **Vector Database**, perform a **web search**, or return a **native LLM response** based on the type of query. 

Here’s an example of how the **Reasoning LLM** can be implemented to evaluate the user's query and decide the best route for answering:

#### **Example of Query Routing Logic**

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = 'your_api_key'

def query_routing_logic(query, vectorstore):
    reasoning_prompt = f"Given the query: '{query}', should I query the Vector DB, perform a web search, or generate a native response?"
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        prompt=reasoning_prompt,
        max_tokens=100
    )
    decision = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    
    if "Vector DB" in decision:
        return query_vector_db(query, vectorstore)
    elif "Web search" in decision:
        return perform_search(query)  # SerpAPI or LLM-driven search
    else:
        return "Answer from native LLM here"
    
# Example query routing
decision_result = query_routing_logic("What's the latest research on tokenomics?", vectorstore)
print(decision_result)
```

The **Reasoning LLM** decides based on the prompt whether to query the **Vector DB**, perform a **web search**, or provide a native response using the LLM.

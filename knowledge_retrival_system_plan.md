## **Project Proposal: Enterprise Knowledge Retrieval System Chatbot**

### **Executive Summary**
This proposal outlines the design and implementation of a knowledge retrieval system chatbot to support VitaDAO's community and token holders. The chatbot will integrate with large language models (LLMs), vector databases containing DAO documents and research data, and an internet search API to provide accurate, real-time responses to user inquiries.

The key functionalities of the chatbot include answering token economics and research-related questions, providing updates on research projects and IP assets, analyzing potential impact of research outcomes, and responding to governance and community participation queries.

### **1. Objectives**

- **Enhance Token Holder Experience**: Provide fast, accurate, and accessible information about token economics, research impact, and governance to VITA token holders.
- **Support VitaDAO Member Engagement**: Enable broader community members to easily access information about research projects, governance, and participation opportunities.
- **Improve Research Transparency**: Make VitaDAO's research portfolio, IP assets, and project progress readily available in a conversational format.
- **Enable Data-Driven Decisions**: Help token holders understand the relationship between research outcomes and token value.

---

### **2. Scope**

The knowledge retrieval system will cover the following areas:
1. **Token and Research Analytics (RAG)**:
   - Real-time token metrics and blockchain activity
   - Research portfolio status and IP assets
   - Impact analysis of research outcomes
   
2. **Community Information**:
   - Governance processes and current proposals
   - Participation opportunities and community initiatives
   - Token holder rights and responsibilities

3. **External Updates**:
   - Latest research developments and milestones
   - Market conditions and token performance
   - Related longevity research news

### **2.1 Example Questions and Use Cases**

The chatbot will be capable of handling various types of queries, including:

#### Token and Economic Questions
- "What is the current VITA token price?"
- "Explain VitaDAO's tokenomics model"
- "Show me recent blockchain activity for VITA"
- "What's the current market cap and circulation?"

#### Research and IP Questions
- "Can you explain the latest research proposal on longevity biomarkers?"
- "What's the current progress of Project X in our portfolio?"
- "Summarize the key findings from our latest completed research"
- "What IP assets does VitaDAO currently hold?"

#### Impact Analysis
- "How would successful completion of Project Y affect token value?"
- "What are the potential implications of this research for VitaDAO's portfolio?"
- "Explain the relationship between research outcomes and token utility"

#### General DAO Information
- "How does VitaDAO's governance process work?"
- "What are the current voting proposals?"
- "How can I participate in research discussions?"

### **3. System Architecture**

The system will be composed of the following components:

#### 3.1 **Frontend (React Web Application)**
- **User Interface**: A responsive web interface allowing users to interact with the chatbot.
- **Chat Interface**: Users can submit text queries and receive responses in a conversational format.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login for internal users to access company policy content.

#### 3.2 **Backend (FastAPI)**
- **Request Processing**: Handles user queries, deciding the appropriate action based on the type of question.
- **LLM Integration**: Connects to a large language model for processing questions and generating responses.
- **Vector DB Integration**: Uses a vector database to store and retrieve company policy documents, leveraging a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach.
- **Internet Search Integration**: Uses APIs to fetch the latest data on members or external topics from the internet.
- **Chat Log Management**: Logs all user interactions for auditing, training, and feedback purposes.
  
#### 3.3 **Databases**
- **Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Faiss, or Weaviate)**: Stores the embeddings of company documents, policies, and other knowledge sources for fast retrieval.
- **SQL Database**: Manages structured data like member information, chatbot logs, and user metadata.

#### 3.4 **Model Integration**
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
  - First, the chatbot will attempt to retrieve relevant information from the vector database based on the user's query.
  - If the query relates to member status, it will query the internet search API.
  - If the query cannot be answered using the above, the chatbot will respond based on the base LLM.

---

### **4. System Flow & Decision Logic**

The backend will follow the decision logic outlined below for query handling:

1. **User submits a query.**
   - If the query relates to company policies or internal documentation:
     - Search the vector database for the most relevant document(s).
     - If results are found, return the information with possible context.
     - If no results are found, proceed to generic LLM response.
   
2. **If the query is about member status:**
   - Use internet search API to gather the most recent status updates.
   - Provide the response with verified external sources.

3. **For generic or ambiguous queries:**
   - Use the base LLM to answer the query, ensuring it's as informative as possible without retrieving from external data.

4. **Logging and Feedback:**
   - All queries will be logged, along with the corresponding response.
   - Feedback mechanisms will be implemented for continuous improvement.

[User Query] 
     |
[Is Query about Company Policy?]
     |----[Yes]----> [Query Vector DB] ----> [Retrieve Relevant Document]
     |                             |
     |                             v

### **5. Technical Requirements**

- **Frontend**: React.js, with additional libraries like Axios for API calls and socket handling for real-time chat interactions.
- **Backend**: FastAPI for efficient, asynchronous request handling and endpoints to serve responses.
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone, Faiss, or Weaviate for document storage and fast retrieval based on embeddings.
- **Internet Search API**: Integration with a reliable API (e.g., SerpAPI, Google Custom Search).
- **LLM**: OpenAI's GPT-4, or a fine-tuned alternative model, depending on licensing and performance.

---

### **6. Security Considerations**

- **Authentication**: Secure access to the chatbot for internal users to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive company information.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that user conversations are anonymized and stored in compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- **Rate Limiting and Monitoring**: Prevent abuse of the system by implementing rate limiting, logging, and alerting for suspicious activities.

### **9. Risk Analysis and Mitigation**

- **Risk**: LLM may not always provide accurate company-specific answers.
  - **Mitigation**: Continuously fine-tune the LLM with new data and feedback to ensure relevance.
  
- **Risk**: Vector database retrieval latency or inaccuracies.
  - **Mitigation**: Use advanced retrieval algorithms and periodic database updates.

- **Risk**: Over-reliance on internet search data.
  - **Mitigation**: Cross-check internet data with internal databases to ensure accuracy.

### **10. Conclusion**

This knowledge retrieval system chatbot will serve as a valuable tool for enhancing both customer and employee experiences by providing accurate, real-time information in a conversational interface. With its multi-tiered approach to information retrieval, it will streamline company policy access, client status tracking, and general knowledge queries. We look forward to discussing this proposal further and moving forward with the project approval.
